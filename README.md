# wifiripper
This script silently extracts all saved Wi-Fi profiles and their passwords 
from a Windows machine and saves them into a text file named:

  wifipassword.txt

📦 What it does:
- Auto-elevates to admin if needed
- Lists all saved Wi-Fi networks
- Extracts stored passwords (if available)
- Runs in the background with no CMD window
- Saves results to the script folder

💡 Usage:
Put this on any USB drive and launch it manually or through social engineering.
This converts a normal pendrive into a basic BadUSB-like tool — no hardware mod needed.

🛡️ For educational and ethical use only.
